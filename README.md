# Water Meter Validity Checker

This Flutter application is designed to calculate the validity of domestic water meters by performing two experiments with a specific machine. The app calculates the error between expected and actual readings, and determines if the water meter is valid based on a tolerance value specified by the worker. 

## Features

- **QR Code Scanning**: The app can scan QR codes to save the reference of water meters.
- **Two Experiments**: It runs two experiments to calculate the error for each water meter.
- **Error Calculation**: Compares the calculated error with a tolerance value set by the worker.
- **Water Meter Validity**: The app determines if the water meter is valid based on the error calculation.
- **Data Storage**: Saves the values of each water meter for future reference.

## How It Works

1. **Scan QR Code**: Use the app to scan the QR code of a water meter to save its reference.
2. **Perform Experiments**: Conduct two experiments using the machine to gather data.
3. **Calculate Error**: The app calculates the error based on the experimental data.
4. **Check Validity**: If the calculated error is less than the tolerance specified by the worker, the meter is valid. Otherwise, it's marked as invalid.
5. **Save Results**: The application saves the reference and the results of the tests for each water meter.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/water-meter-validity-checker.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd water-meter-validity-checker
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the app on your device or emulator.
2. Scan the QR code of a water meter to register it in the app.
3. Follow the instructions to perform the two experiments.
4. View the calculated error and validity status of the water meter.
5. Save the results for future reference.

## Dependencies

- `flutter_barcode_scanner`: For scanning QR codes.
- `provider`: For state management (if used).
- Any additional packages for performing calculations and saving data.
